        "text": "Payments platforms degrade when the ledger is an afterthought. TigerBeetle’s architecture treats the ledger as the CPU-hot, consensus-aware center of your system—not another table in a general database. For a digital-first fintech like ShopWallet, that means higher throughput on fewer machines, stronger guarantees under failure, and cleaner product patterns (authorise/post/void, FX, caps) that ship faster and scale cleaner. In a world chasing LLM gloss, this is the quiet infrastructure that actually moves money."
