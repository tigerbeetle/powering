# Powering

To appear on https://tigerbeetle.com/stories/#powering, add yourself to entities.json and place your logo in the logos directory.

Note that your logo will appear on a dark background, so it should ideally have light colors and a transparent background.

Then, submit your pull request!

## Previewing

You can preview how your logo and text will look on the website by starting an HTTP server (for example  by running `python3 -m http.server`), then opening http://localhost:8000/preview.html.
